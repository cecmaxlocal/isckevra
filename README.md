## üìñ About The Project

`isckevra` is the core source code and development environment for the **IDEMarket** platform. The goal of this project is to create a seamless, integrated experience for both IDEA users looking to discover new tools and developers wishing to share their creations with the community.

This repository contains all necessary development files, from source code and libraries to build scripts and IDE configurations.

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Plugin Discovery:** A clean, searchable interface to browse and find IDEA plugins.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Easy submission and management portal for plugin developers.
*   **Community Driven:** User ratings, reviews, and feedback system.
*   **IDE Integration:** (Future Goal) A companion plugin to browse and install directly from within IntelliJ IDEA.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository is organized to facilitate development within IntelliJ IDEA. Here is a breakdown of the key directories:

```
isckevra/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .idea/            # IntelliJ IDEA project-specific settings and configurations.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/              # Contains compiled output, executables, or helper scripts.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/              # External libraries and dependencies (.jar files) used by the project.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # Main application source code (e.g., Java, Kotlin).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ T/                # (T)ests, (T)emplates, or (T)ools - contains project-specific assets.
‚îÇ                     # Please clarify: Is this for Tests, Templates, or Tools?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore        # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml           # Or build.gradle - Project build configuration for Maven or Gradle.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file.
```

-   **`./.idea`**: Stores all project-specific settings for IntelliJ IDEA. This allows the team to share a consistent development environment.
-   **`./bin`**: (Binary) Holds compiled code, executables, or shell scripts used for running or deploying the application.
-   **`./lib`**: (Library) Contains all third-party dependencies (`.jar` files) that the project relies on.
-   **`./T`**: The purpose of this directory should be defined by the team. Common uses include:
    -   **T**ests: Unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
    -   **T**emplates: HTML, email, or configuration templates.
    -   **T**ools: Custom scripts or utilities for development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA**: Community or Ultimate Edition.
*   **Apache Maven** or **Gradle**: To manage dependencies and build the project.

### Installation & Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/isckevra.git
    cd isckevra
    ```

2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:**
    -   Go to `File > Open...`
    -   Navigate to the cloned `isckevra` directory and select it.
    -   IDEA will automatically detect the Maven/Gradle configuration and sync the dependencies from `lib/` and the remote repository.

3.  **Build the project:**
    -   **Using Maven:**
        ```sh
        mvn clean install
        ```
    -   **Using Gradle:**
        ```sh
        ./gradlew build
        ```
    - The compiled artifacts will be placed in the `target` (for Maven) or `build` (for Gradle) directory, and any necessary files may be copied to `bin/`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

<!-- Add instructions on how to run or use the final application. -->
<!-- For example: -->

Once the project is successfully built, you can run the main application class from within IntelliJ IDEA or by executing the script in the `bin/` directory:

```sh
./bin/start-server.sh
```

The IDEMarket will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
